mapping-step-counter
====================

This is an Android application that detects the number of steps taken by the user, the direction of the steps and the current position of the user relative to the starting point. Everytime a step is taken, the location of the user is updated on the map. The application also provides a route to get from one point to another for certain maps. 

This application was created in a group during my first year Embedded Systems course. We only created the src/ca/uwaterloo/lab4_202_06/MainActivity.java file.
